# What is Graular?

Graular is a a portemanteau term referring to the amalgamation of two technologies: Grails and Angular JS.

Graular uses a straight-up Grails application for serving content to both anonymous and authenticated users. Authenticated users then have a generous sprinkling of rainbow glitter applied to these pages in the form of Angular JS directives, controllers and services.
